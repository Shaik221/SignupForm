Sample Signup Form with few input fields like FirstName, email, password and website 
# Technology stack

- Used Material themes and TextInput layouts for the UI
# Enhancements 
- Implemented form input validation for the required fields i.e. Email and password
- Shared ViewModel implemented to share the data between SignUpFragment, Confirmation Fragment
# Setup and Running project
